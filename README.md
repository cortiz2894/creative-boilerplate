# Creative Boilerplate

A modern creative development boilerplate built with Next.js, Three.js, and React Three Fiber.  
This repository is my personal production-ready setup for building interactive 3D experiences, experiments, and client projects.

It includes a fully integrated **3D Playground** to quickly prototype scenes, test lighting setups, import GLB models, and iterate visually in real time.

## ✨ What is this?

**Creative Boilerplate** is the exact foundation I use for:

- Client 3D experiences  
- Interactive landing pages  
- Creative coding experiments  
- WebGL playgrounds  
- Real-time shader explorations  

This project is in **constant active development**, meaning dependencies and technologies are kept up to date. You can rely on this setup being aligned with the current ecosystem standards.

## 🎮 3D Playground

A built-in development environment designed for rapid iteration and scene exploration.

### Features

- Orbit camera controls
- Real-time light manipulation
- Environment / HDRI support
- Shadow configuration
- GLB model import & preview
- Transform controls (position, rotation, scale)
- Live parameter tweaking via GUI

The playground allows you to quickly test lighting setups, validate models, explore materials, and prototype interactions before moving into production code.
